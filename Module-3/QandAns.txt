Q. How to change in components of React Js?
Ans :   Here are a few ways to change components in React JS. One way is to use the useState hook. The useState hook allows you to create a state variable in your 	component. You can then use the setState method to update the state variable. When the state variable changes, the component will re-render.
	-> Another way to change components in React JS is to use the useEffect hook. The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in your component, such as 	fetching data or updating the DOM. When the component mounts, the useEffect hook will be called. The useEffect hook will also be called whenever any of the 	component's dependencies change.

Q: How to Create a List View in React Js?
Ans:There are a few different ways to create a list view in React. One way is to use the ul and li elements. Another way is to use the ListView component from the React Native library.
To create a list view using the ul and li elements, you can use the following code:
	<ul>
 	 {listItems.map((item) => (
 	 <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
	  ))}
	</ul>

	To create a list view using the ListView component, you can use the following code:
	<ListView
  	dataSource={dataSource}
  	renderRow={(rowData) => <Text>{rowData.name}</Text>}
	/>
